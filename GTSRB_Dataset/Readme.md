Deep Convolutional Neural Networks implementation on [German Traffc Sign Recognition Benchmark Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) <br />

Takeaways: <br />
1. Kaggle folder structure and Dataset Exploration
2. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks from scratch with Tensorflow. <br />

TO Do: <br />
- [x] Get rid of avoidable bias. <br />
-[ ] Model has High Variance, need to reduce it. <br />
-[ ] Use Learning Rate Scheduler.
